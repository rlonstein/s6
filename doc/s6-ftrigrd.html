<h1> The s6-ftrigrd program </h1>

<p>
s6-ftrigrd is a helper program that manages a set of subscriptions to fifodirs as well
as regular expressions on events. It takes orders from its client program that controls
it via the <a href="libftrigr.html">ftrigr library</a>, and notifies it when desired
events happen.
</p>

<h2> Interface </h2>

<p>
 s6-ftrigrd is not meant to be called directly.
</p>

<ul>
 <li> If the client program uses <tt>ftrigr_startf()</tt>, it spawns an instance of
s6-ftrigrd as a child. s6-ftrigrd's stdin is a pipe reading from the client; its
stdout is a pipe writing to the client; its stderr is the same as the client's; and
there's an additional pipe from s6-ftrigrd to the client, used for asynchronous
notifications. </li>
 <li> If the client program uses <tt>ftrigr_start()</tt>, then it tries to connect
to a Unix domain socket. A <em>ftrigrd service</em> should be listening to that
socket, i.e. a Unix domain superserver such as
<a href="http://www.skarnet.org/software/s6-networking/s6-ipcserver.html">s6-ipcserver</a>
spawning a s6-ftrigrd program on every connection. Then a s6-ftrigrd instance is created
for the client: its stdin and stdout are the socket, its stderr is normally logged
by the service's logger, and there's also an additional pipe from s6-ftrigrd to the
client, used for asynchronous notifications. Such a pipe can exist thanks to some
Unix black magic (the
<a href="http://www.skarnet.org/software/skalibs/libunixonacid/ancillary.h">libancillary</a>,
if you must know). </li>
 <li> When the client uses <tt>ftrigr_end()</tt>, or closes s6-ftrigrd's stdin in
any way, s6-ftrigrd exits 0. </li>
</ul>

<p>
 s6-ftrigrd handles the grunt work of creating fifos in a
<a href="fifodir.html">fifodir</a> for a subscriber. It also wakes up on every
event, and compares the chain of events it received on a given fifodir with the
client-provided regexp. If the chain of events matches the regexp, it notifies
the client.
</p>

<h2> Notes </h2>

<p>
 The connection management between the client and s6-ftrigrd is entirely done
by the <a href="http://www.skarnet.org/software/skalibs/libunixonacid/skaclient.html">skaclient</a>
library. The protocol uses <a href="http://cr.yp.to/proto/netstrings.txt">netstrings</a>
for message boundaries.
</p>

<p>
 s6-ftrigrd is entirely asynchronous. It stores unread notifications into heap
memory; it can grow in size if there are a lot of events and the client fails
to read them. To avoid uncontrolled growth, make sure your client calls
<tt>ftrigr_update()</tt> as soon as <tt>ftrigr_fd()</tt> becomes readable.
