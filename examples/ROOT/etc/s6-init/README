This is an example directory containing booting scripts
that lead to s6-svscan running as process 1 in stage 2.

Read them carefully and edit them to suit your needs.
Some scripts are Linux-dependent; they can be easily
adapted to other Unix systems.

The skarnet.org servers actually run such a system, with
scripts that are based on this model.

As of s6-0.18, these scripts depend on yet-unreleased
software such as s6-portable-utils and s6-linux-utils.
This should not be a problem, the functionality exists
in other software:
 - generally, s6-foobar can be replaced with foobar
   (s6-mount, s6-echo, etc.)
 - s6-nuke -th can be replaced with kill -TERM -1 followed by
   kill -CONT -1 followed by kill -HUP -1
 - s6-nuke -k can be replaced with kill -KILL -1
 - s6-hiercopy can be replaced with cp -a, if supported, or
   cp -pPR of not)

execline, however, cannot and should not be replaced.
Shell scripts cannot perform the redirfd trick in stage 1.
