This service reads from the "fifo" named pipe and logs
what it reads to the /tmp/uncaught-logs log directory.
The whole supervision tree has its stderr redirected to "fifo",
as well as services that do not have their own logger.
So, /tmp/uncaught-logs is the catch-all logger: logs that aren't
caught anywhere else end up there.
