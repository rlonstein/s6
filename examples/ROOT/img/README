This directory is read-only. It contains the service
repository (actually one list of services that do not
need the network and one list of services that can only
be started after the network is up), and an image of the
tmpfs that it copied as-is at boot-time (during stage 1
init).
This directory is only used at boot-time, it is never
written to (the service directories are copied as-is
to /service during stage 2 init).
